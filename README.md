# engineering-student-placement-analysis
End-to-end data analytics project analyzing engineering student placement readiness using Excel, SQL, Python EDA, and Power BI.
# Engineering Student Placement Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analytics analysis of engineering student performance and placement readiness. The dataset includes academic performance, technical skills, lifestyle factors, and demographic attributes. The objective of the project is to understand what factors influence student outcomes beyond CGPA and to present insights using interactive visualizations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Initial data exploration and pivot analysis  
- **SQL** – Data storage and analytical querying  
- **Python** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation  

---


## Key Analysis Performed
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Correlation analysis of numeric features
- Branch-wise, skill-wise, and lifestyle-based comparisons
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholder insights

## Key Insights
- Academic performance alone does not define placement readiness
- Practical skills and project exposure strongly influence aptitude
- Lifestyle factors such as stress and sleep have indirect impact
- Student success is multidimensional

## Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize academic, skill, and lifestyle insights in a single-page view.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics workflow from raw data exploration to insight-driven visualization.
